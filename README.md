##Overview
Puppet module to manage the Microsoft Windows Firewall

##Module Description

##Setup

###What windows_firewall affects:

* windows firewall service and corrisponding Windows Registry keys
* windows registry keys and values for any defined exception rules

###Setup Requirements

For this module to run correctly, you must have [pluginsync enabled](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/plugins_in_modules.html#enabling-pluginsync). 

This setting will ensure the types and providers are synchronized and available on the agent before the configuration run takes place. This is the default behavior of the puppet agent on Microsoft Windows platforms. 

###Beginning with windows_firewall
To begin using Windows_firewall, you must download the module to your puppet master. This module is intended for installation on a *nix master for use with a Windows agent.


The windows_firewall resource allows you to manage the firewall service itself. 

	class { 'windows_firewall': ensure => 'stopped' }

Once the windows firewall is managed you may then want to start managing the rules and exceptions within it. 

    windows_firewall::exception { 'WINRM':
      ensure       => present,
      direction    => 'in',
      action       => 'Allow',
      enabled      => 'yes',
      protocol     => 'TCP',
      remoteip     => '10.0.0.0/8',
      local_port   => '5985',
      display_name => 'Windows Remote Management HTTP-In',
      description  => 'Inbound rule for Windows Remote Management via WS-Management. [TCP 5985]',
    }

##Usage

###Class: `windows_firewall`

The `windows_firewall` resource allows you to use Puppet to manage the firewall service itself.

    class { 'windows_firewall':
        ensure => 'stopped'
    }

In the above example the windows firewall is made sure to be running during each puppet run.

#### Parameters in `windows_firewall`

#####`ensure`
Determines whether or not the service must be running and enabled. If not included, the module will assume that the windows firewall service should be running and enabled. Valid values are 'running' and 'stopped'.

###Defined Type: `windows_firewall::exception`

The `windows_firewall::exception` defined type allows the management of indivdual rules in the windows firewall.

You can either define an exception for a specific port:

    windows_firewall::exception { 'WINRM':
        ensure       => present,
        direction    => 'in',
        action       => 'Allow',
        enabled      => 'yes',
        protocol     => 'TCP',
        remoteip     => 'any',
        local_port   => '5985',
        display_name => 'Windows Remote Management HTTP-In',
        description  => 'Inbound rule for Windows Remote Management via WS-Management. [TCP 5985]',
    }

Or you can define an exception for a specific program:

    windows_firewall::exception { 'myapp':
        ensure       => present,
        direction    => 'in',
        action       => 'Allow',
        enabled      => 'yes',
        program      => 'C:\\myapp.exe',
        remoteip     => 'any',
        display_name => 'My App',
        description  => 'Inbound rule for My App',
    }

#### Parameters in `windows_firewall::exception`

#####`ensure`
Determines whether or not the firewall exception is 'present' or 'absent'

#####`description`
A description of the exception to apply. 

#####`display_name`

#####`direction`
Sets the direction of the exception rule, either: 'in' or 'out'.

#####`action`

#####`enabled`
Determines whether the exception is enabled, either: 'yes' or 'no'. Defaults to 'yes'.

#####`protocol`
Sets the protocol to be included in the exception rule, either: 'TCP' or 'UDP'.

#####`local_port`
Defines the port to be included in the exception for port-based exception rules.

#####`remoteip`
Defines the remote IP address to be included in the exception.

#####`program`
Defines the full path to the program to be included in the exception for program-based exception rules.
